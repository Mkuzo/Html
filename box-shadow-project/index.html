    <h1>Learning CSS Box-Shadow</h1>

    <p>Box-shadow is a CSS property that lets you add shadow effects to elements, creating depth and emphasis on a page. It can simulate natural lighting by offsetting shadows and controlling blur and spread values. Using box-shadow helps improve visual hierarchy and make components stand out without extra markup. Different combinations of offsets, blur, spread, and color produce a wide range of looks from subtle to dramatic.</p>

    <h2>Basic Box Shadow</h2>
    <div class="basic-shadow">This is a basic box shadow.</div>

    <h2>Multiple Shadows</h2>
    <div class="multi-shadow">This box has multiple shadows.</div>

    <h2>Inset Shadow</h2>
    <div class="inset-shadow">This box uses inset shadow.</div>

    <h2>Blur vs Spread</h2>
    <div class="blur-spread">Blur and spread example.</div>

    <h2>Colored Shadows</h2>
    <div class="color-shadow">This box has a colored shadow.</div>

    <h2>Shadow Challenge</h2>
    <p>Create your own box with a shadow of your choice. Experiment with different colors, offsets, blur, and spread values to see how the shadow changes the perceived depth. Put your box below and style the class <code>my-shadow</code> in <code>style.css</code>.</p>
    <div class="my-shadow">My own shadow design.</div>

    <h2>Final Challenge</h2>
    <p>What I learned: I learned how the <code>box-shadow</code> property controls shadow offset, blur, spread, and color to create depth. The easiest shadow was the basic shadow because it only requires a single set of offsets and a blur value. The hardest was creating multiple shadows that look natural together since balancing colors and offsets can be tricky. My favourite effect is the colored shadow because it adds personality and can make elements pop when used tastefully.</p>
